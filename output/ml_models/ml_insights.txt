MACHINE LEARNING INSIGHTS
================================================================================

1. BEST OVERALL MODEL: Linear Regression (AAPL) with R²=0.9986
2. MOST CONSISTENT MODEL: Linear Regression with avg R²=0.9884
3. LEAST OVERFITTING: Ridge Regression (AAPL) with 0.0006
4. HIGHEST ACCURACY: Ridge Regression (MSFT) with MAPE=0.24%

5. RECOMMENDATIONS:
   - For production: Choose models with R² > 0.85 and low overfitting
   - For stability: Prefer ensemble methods (Random Forest, XGBoost)
   - For interpretability: Consider Linear/Ridge/Lasso if performance is acceptable
